Thats right, hello, Hugo.

I have finally decided on a blogging platform to start this journey as a writer of technical topics. As with any good first dip into a new experience, be it's a new programming language or skydiving, it's always good to start with a `Hello, World`.

So here we are. Welcome to my blog. No idea how you got here so fast, but kudos, you might be the first. 

Thanks for stopping by and I hope you do again soon when there is more here to offer you.
